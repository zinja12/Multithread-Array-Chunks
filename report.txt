Thread Report

Intro:
	Threading allows for concurrency. It allows a process to do multiple
	things, like execute functions, at the same time. With threads this
	project we are able to process data concurrently and combine and
	interpret results at the end of the processing.

Data:
	Size          Time              # Threads
		      User Time
		      
	999           0.000999		2

	999	      0.000000		4

	999999	      0.003999		2

	999999	      0.002999		6

Report:
	As the number of threads increases the time taken to process the data
	decreases. This can be seen in the first and second entries where
	increasing the number of threads decreases the time taken to process.
	This can also be seen with the third and fourth entries where the data
	size is drastically increased and increasing the amount of threads
	also decreases the time taken to process said data. However, I have
	noticed that it takes time to create the threads which can cause more
	Wall and System time and sometimes User time. Another thing that I
	noticed is that the time it takes to run the threads on the grace
	system is different based on the other users that are on the server
	at the same time. This is most likely due to the number of threads
	and processes that the grace system can be running at one time among
	all of the users.
