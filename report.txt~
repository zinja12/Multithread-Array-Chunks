Thread Report

Intro:
	Threading allows for concurrency. It allows a process to do multiple
	things, like execute functions, at the same time. With threads this
	project we are able to process data concurrently and combine and
	interpret results at the end of the processing.

Data:
	Size          Time              # Threads
		      User Time
		      
	999           0.000999		2

	999	      0.000000		4

	999999	      0.003999		2

	999999	      0.002999		6

Report:
	As the number of threads increases the time taken to process the data
	decreases. This can be seen in the first and second entries where
	increasing the number of threads decreases the time taken to process.
	This can also be seen with the third and fourth entries where the data
	size is drastically increased and increasing the amount of threads
	also decreases the time taken to process said data.
